# HS-Bot-Project
### HS-Bot - 2020 extrusion motion system (3D-printer) designed from the ground up to work with E3D Tool-changer system

#### Hardware Features Overview
- Tool-changer capabilities
- Core-XY
- Linear rails on all axes
- Two or three independent Z axis lead-screws for auto bed tramming (real auto bed leveling)
- 5V and 24V Power supply (using a relay)
- Heated aluminium printbed (silicone heater mat)
- Enclosure
- Rigid cube-like frame
- Size: 440mm, 440mm, 450mm (l, w, h)
- Build volume: 220mm x 300mm


#### Goal of this Project
The main goal of this project is to create a "cheap" diy solution to implement the e3d tool-changing system in a way that it "just works".
In contrast to other diy (or cheap chinese)  3d-printers this project is not like a toy but much rather like a professional tool. 
Using duet3ds software features in combination with multiple sensors the printer "just works" without failed prints. The printer does (almost) everything on its own.
