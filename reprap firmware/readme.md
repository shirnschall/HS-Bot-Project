These files are intended for [RepRap firmware 3.1.1](https://github.com/Duet3D/RepRapFirmware/releases/tag/3.1.1).    
If you want to use a newer version please check the [changelog of each version that came after v3.1.1](https://github.com/Duet3D/RepRapFirmware/wiki/Changelog-RRF-3.x) if gcode commands have changed.

As we are using conditional gcode you will have to use RepRap firmware 3.x.
